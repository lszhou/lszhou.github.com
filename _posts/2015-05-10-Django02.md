> In which the Elves under Elu Thingol rebuff the first assault of Morgoth's Orcs, even in the hour of Feanor's arrival in Middle Earth.

From last blog, we have prepared the environment (Python, Django and optional DB) for our first django web app *project*. In django, a *project* is defined to be "*A collection of settings for an instance of Django, including database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific settings.*"

Before we start a new project, take care the workspace directory. For example, I change directory to my linux *document*  directory.

```
$ pwd
$ /home/lszhou/Documents
```
Let's start a new django project with the following command which will creat a directory *mysite* in my current directory *Documents*.

```
$ django-admin.py startproject mysite
```
