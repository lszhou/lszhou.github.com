> In which the Elves under Elu Thingol rebuff the first assault of Morgoth's Orcs, even in the hour of Feanor's arrival in Middle Earth.

From last blog, we have prepared the environment (Python, Django and optional DB) for our first django web app *project*. In django, a *project* is defined to be "*A collection of settings for an instance of Django, including database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific settings.*"

Before we start a new project, take care the workspace directory. For example, I change directory to my linux *document*  directory.

```
$ pwd
$ /home/username/Documents
```
Let's start a new django project with the following command which will creat a directory *mysite* in my current directory *Documents*.

```
$ django-admin.py startproject mysite
```
![ ](/home/lszhou/Desktop/Screenshot.jpg  "Create a new django project mysite")

"django-admin" is Djangoâ€™s command-line utility for administrative tasks. It will be frequently used in the following discussion together with another command "manage.py".

The usage is simple:

```
$ django-admin <command> [options]
```
For more commands and description, please use the following command to check. The [django official document](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/django-admin/) also provides well-written description.

```
$ django-admin help
```

> Note

>- The above command django-admin.py maybe a little different based on how you set up your environment. i.e, If you use *pip* to install django like me, them *django-admin.py* should already be in the linux system path. 

> - If you install django via some package stuff, then the command should be *django-admin* without extension *.py*.  Moreover, prior to django 1.7, django-admin was only installed as django-admin.py. (My current version is 1.4.0, thus I should apply ".py" extension.)

>- Additionally, in [Windows](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/windows/) environment, you may also need to set the environment avriable **PATH**  (under Settings - Control Panel - System - Advanced - Environment...) to point to its installed location, i.e, add *C:\Python34\;C:\Python34\Scripts;* to your **PATH**. 

>- Actually, based on some of my experience, Windows is really not a suitable OS to do django, the process and setting is realatively complicated and confusing.
