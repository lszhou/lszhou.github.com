title: Web App Framework Introduction
---

Web application framework is well applied in today's application development. The definition for web app framework provided by [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework) is "A web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources."

The so called "full-stack" frameworks are those "who gathered multiple libraries useful for web development into a single cohesive software stack for web developers to use. Examples of this include ASP.NET, JavaEE (Servlets), Ruby on Rails, Grails, Django and so on.

Here are the different frameworks for various languages:

- PHP: Zend, Symfony, Phpdevshell.
- Python: Django, web2py, Cherrypy.
- Java: Struts, Spring, Tapestry, GWT.
- Ruby: Ruby on Rails.
- Javasript: JavaScriptMVC.

In the next several blogs, I would like to have some discussion and experiments on the google's app engine (GAE) and Django framework. Specifically, I would like to do the following work:

- Brief introduction to GAE and learn how to deploy a simple python-based web application to GAE. 

- Use Python Django framework tp build a simple web application.
