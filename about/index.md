#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> About Me

My name is Longsheng Zhou, a software developer living in Calgary.  I have a bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics and I am pursuing a master degree in Computer Science now, doing some wonderful reasearch with [Dr.Philipp Woelfel](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~woelfel/) in randomized shared memory.

In the recent 5 years, I mostly focus on information technology and software-related application development, with a special interest in distributed computing, multi-threaded processing and concurrent data structures. I've also enjoyed the challenges and experience in engineering mathematics and numerical techniques.
