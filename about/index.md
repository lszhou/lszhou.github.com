#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> About Me

My name is Longsheng Zhou, a software development engineer living in Calgary. I was born in [Funing](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Funing,+Yancheng,+Jiangsu,+China/@33.1589079,121.7183449,4z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x35b9c3a6c3f13e7f:0xb3605c3b1285a51b), a small but peaceful town in the mainland of China and lived there for around 20 years with my parents.

I spent 4 years in [Nanjing](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Nanjing,+Jiangsu,+China/@32.5853319,120.1116328,7z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x35b58c9b668dcd83:0x8ffbb60b79df1b06), the capital of Jiangsu province and got my bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics in 2012 from [Southeast University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_University).

After that, I was enrolled in the Ph.D program of the School of Automation (Southeast University), where I accomplished my bachelor thesis/project "Performance Analysis of [Differential-algebraic Subsystems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_algebraic_equation)" under the supervision of [Dr.Xianzhong Dai](http://automation.seu.edu.cn/Articles.aspx?id=620). But I dropped out later becasue I finally decided to move to Canada. In the rest of time in 2013, I worked as a developer and system analyst for the Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of Complex Systems of Engineering (Electricity/Energy Syst, Ministry of Education, China).

I am now pursuing a master degree in Computer Science in the [University of Calgary](http://www.ucalgary.ca/), doing some wonderful reasearch with [Dr.Philipp Woelfel](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~woelfel/) in randomized [shared memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory_%28interprocess_communication%29).

At the same time, I am working as a Backend Software Developer in quirklogic, Inc and invloved in the developement of cloud service for a fantastic cutting edge device.

Briefly, I mostly focus on web apps/web-tech desktop apps and Node.js cloud service development, with a special interest in RESTful API, distributed computing/communication, multithreading, data analysis and visualization. I also enjoy the challenges in numerical computing and pure math.
